# DataStructures
## Overview

**Welcome to this Subdirectory !**

This Sub-D aims to provide simple and easy-to-understand implementations of basic data structures in C to help beginners understand the concepts and get hands-on experience working with these simple data structures
<br>If you've ever struggled to find straightforward code examples , you've come to the right place.

## How It Came About ?

The motivation behind this Subdirectory stems from my own experience when I first delved into learning about data structures. I encountered either excessively complex implementations or explanations that were too intricate, hindering my understanding of these concepts.
<br>Today while I was looking through my old drive, I stumbled upon a few C files containing these simple data structures so I decided to quickly re-write and debug them and get them uploaded here for others to benefit from.

## What's Expected
In this directory, you'll find a straightforward and concise implementations of fundamental data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, and simple binary search trees. These implementations were made suitable for individuals who are still learning about them without unnecessary complexity or confusion.

Please note that this folder focuses on basic data structures, so threre are no advanced data structures like AVL trees, red-black trees, B-trees, graphs nor hash tables. Their implementation in C can be more intricate compared to other programming languages, plus this is primarily aimed at beginners, providing them with a solid foundation to build upon.

Also note that while these implementations aim to be beginner-friendly, they may not be optimized for performance in real-world scenarios. The primary focus here is on simplicity and learning.

## Contents 

This Directory currently includes the following data structures: 
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- BST ( Binary Seach Trees ) 

## Note

Throughout the code , you may notice that I refer to a node as a tree, a queue, or a stack. Please note that this is done for the purpose of simplifying the understanding and working with the code.

For example, when you see a line like :
```C
queue *head = malloc(sizeof(queue)) ;
```

It means that I am creating a standard node, but in this case, it will be used for a queue data structure.

By using familiar terminology associated with different data structures, it helps to conceptualize and relate the node to its usage in specific contexts.
<br>Just remember that at its core, it is still a node, and the data structure it belongs to depends on its implementation and usage.


I hope you find this Directory helpful !
